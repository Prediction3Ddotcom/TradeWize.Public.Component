00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
Your contract states that each work order is a job-specific contract detailing your payment upon checklist completion.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.160
When you select a job, a work order is generated under My Jobs and added to Payments, as shown here.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.360
You will notice the word Future shown under the Pay Date for any jobs not started or not marked as complete yet.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.840
Once all checklists are complete and quality-approved, you will see paid under the Pay Date.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.920
This means payment has been sent to the bank you set up under your account.
