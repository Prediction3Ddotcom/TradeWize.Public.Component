00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
After you complete your onboarding and training videos,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.040
you can now search and accept available jobs for your role

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.600
and any roles under you by clicking on the job board icon.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.480
You can filter by location, radius, community, start date, lot number, or workers,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.280
then simply click Apply.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.680
Select any job shown to see the actual location on the map.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
You will see estimated start and completion dates shown for each job.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.400
To accept a job, click on the checkbox next to the lot number and click Register.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.640
You will then be asked to confirm that you want to register for that job.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.040
After clicking Confirm, any accepted jobs will now appear under the My Jobs icon.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.120
You can accept jobs up to two weeks out and view later dates.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.600
But don't worry, the system will prevent you from accepting jobs that will create

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.760
overlapping to ensure quality work.
